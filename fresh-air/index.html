        <p> At Fresh Air, we believe that social media, as great as it is to keep in touch with loved ones and to find out how what is of the life of that good friend we used to have in elementary school. It has created a media version of ourselves. A digital person that is not really us, but it has been created by an algorithm that is interpreting our interests, this being the trend of the moment or the hopes and dreams that we have. Our digital self is not really the person that we really are. We are much more cautious, loving, respectful. People show a different face when they think that nobody is watching. We do not believe that this is the real you. You are not alone making decisions on your phone or computer, but you are being pushed by the unlimited suggestions that get to you only because once you search for something or show a little interest on a post. Or because the data suggest that you are of certain gender or age and that means that you must identify with the websitesâ€™ idea of who you are. We believe that you can find yourself better when you disconnect and step outside in nature. Where you can see a beautiful scene that brings you back to the real reality. That when you disconnect from technology, for a day or two, you leave the worries behind and find yourself contemplating who you truly are and what truly makes you happy.</p>
