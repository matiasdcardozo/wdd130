        At Fresh Air, we believe that social media, as great as it is to keep in touch with loved ones and to find out how what is of the life of that good friend we used to have in elementary school. It has created a media version of ourselves. A digital person that is not really us, but it has been created by an algorithm that is interpreting our interests, this being the trend of the moment or the hopes and dreams that we have. Our digital self is not really the person that we really are. We are much more cautious, loving, respectful. People show a different face when they think that nobody is watching. We do not believe that this is the real you. You are not alone making decisions on your phone or computer, but you are being pushed by the unlimited suggestions that get to you only because once you search for something or show a little interest on a post. Or because the data suggest that you are of certain gender or age and that means that you must identify with the websitesâ€™ idea of who you are. We believe that you can find yourself better when you disconnect and step outside in nature. Where you can see a beautiful scene that brings you back to the real reality. That when you disconnect from technology, for a day or two, you leave the worries behind and find yourself contemplating who you truly are and what truly makes you happy.

      <h3>Freedom from technology</h3>
      <p>
        Fresh Air is dedicated to help people of all ages, culture and gender, understand the importance of disconnecting from screen and mobile devices. It is a proven fact that screen before going to bed, will contribute to a bad night sleep. The same way, screen will occupy and entertain the brain in a way that it becomes very close to the patterns of addiction. Now a days we can see that people are having a really hard time even using the bathroom without bringing their devices. Devices and technology are an amazing tool that can help us to create a bright future, but only if we control it and not let it control us.

      <h3>Family time</h3>
      <p>
        Family time has become more important than ever in the last couple of years. We can see road trips, people at the park or camping, that are not enjoying nature and their surroundings because of the attention giving to mobile devices. The times that need to be used to connect with our kids and parents is easily being replace by just scrolling on social media. Sometimes even without having something specific in our minds of what we are looking for. This is not only a youth problem that we are facing but we see many adults, parents and grandparents that have been seduced by the warmth of a screen and is taking them away from the loved ones that are right next to them. Our goal is, that by recognizing the power and influence of technology in our lives, we would be able to learn to control ourselves in a way that we can use technology to our advantage. To keep in touch with the loved ones that have moved away. To learn something new with our kids and be able to fact check any questions that kids might bring from school. We can use technology to stay up to date with the world and be able to protect our families, but we should not allow technology to do the parenting for us. We should make sure that our kids learn moral values and what is coming next in their life from family time and being taught with love by parents and not to expect that by them having access to the internet, that they will learn it soon enough by some random stranger in a website.
