        <p> Family time has become more important than ever in the last couple of years. We can see road trips, people at the park or camping, that are not enjoying nature and their surroundings because of the attention giving to mobile devices. The times that need to be used to connect with our kids and parents is easily being replace by just scrolling on social media. Sometimes even without having something specific in our minds of what we are looking for. This is not only a youth problem that we are facing but we see many adults, parents and grandparents that have been seduced by the warmth of a screen and is taking them away from the loved ones that are right next to them. Our goal is, that by recognizing the power and influence of technology in our lives, we would be able to learn to control ourselves in a way that we can use technology to our advantage. To keep in touch with the loved ones that have moved away. To learn something new with our kids and be able to fact check any questions that kids might bring from school. We can use technology to stay up to date with the world and be able to protect our families, but we should not allow technology to do the parenting for us. We should make sure that our kids learn moral values and what is coming next in their life from family time and being taught with love by parents and not to expect that by them having access to the internet, that they will learn it soon enough by some random stranger in a website.</p>
