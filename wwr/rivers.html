        <h4>Planning a staff incentive trip or meeting retreat?  Look no further! Whitewater rafting in offers an exciting opportunity for true team participation and peer interaction.
            Whitewater rafting is something that all members of your group can enjoy, even those with no previous experience. The sense of adventure brings teams closer, and provides the opportunity to work together and achieve a goal.  The supportive atmosphere as your group experiences something new and exciting together helps nurture successful working relationships and promote self, and team, confidence.
            Throughout our years of operation we’ve taken many groups of colleagues for a whitewater experience.  A common response for us is that participants have gotten to know their friend or colleague better in one afternoon on the river than they have in a year at the office. We are confident that you will find the same results.</h4>
